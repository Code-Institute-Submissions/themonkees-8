## CREATE A WEBSITE FOR A BAND
-	Build a static (front-end only) website for a band. As a starting point, you may want to use wireframes, as we did in the UX lesson (you can use Balsamiq or any other tool, including just pen and paper). You can use either your assets or the assets within the following GitHub repo.
-	The band is a 1960’s rock band and have around 50 years experience of performing live at numerous events around the world. You have been given the following requirements after interviews with the client’s representatives:
 	- Their primary target audiences are their fans and potential fans who wish to use the site to see and hear clips from their back catalog, and any new material as it becomes available.
	- Also, the band would like to use the site to showcase their music and publicise their availability to perform at events such as weddings and Christmas parties.
-	The band has provided you, the developer, with the following assets that they would like to showcase on their website:
	- Photos of the band members
	- A video clip
	- Audio clips
-	Also, they are in the process of creating a social media presence and would like to add links to their Facebook, Twitter and YouTube pages.

## Guidelines

Use the following guidelines when developing your project:
-	Create a website of around 4-5 pages, or (if using a single scrolling page) these should be separate page areas.
-	Incorporate main navigation and grid layout (you might want to use Flexbox or Bootstrap to accomplish this).
-	Whenever possible, strive to use semantic HTML5 elements to structure your HTML code better.
-	Make sure your site is as responsive as possible. You can test this by checking the website on different screen sizes and browsers.
-	We advise that you write down user stories and create wireframes/mockups before embarking on full-blown development.
-	The site can also make use of CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap, just make sure you maintain a clear separation between the library code and your code.
-	You should conduct and document tests to ensure that all of your website’s functionality works well.
-	Write a README.md file for your project that explains what the project does and the need that it fulfills. It should also describe the functionality of the project, as well as the technologies used. Detail how the project was deployed and tested and if some of the work was based on other code, explain what was kept and how it was changed to fit your need. A project submitted without a README.md file will FAIL.
-	Use Git & GitHub for version control. Each new piece of functionality should be in a separate commit.
-	Deploy the final version of your code to a hosting platform such as GitHub Pages.
